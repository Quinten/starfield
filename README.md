# starfield

This is a demo of a starfield/starwarp. Inspired by the old windows screensaver where you fly through space.

I once read an informative computer book (can't remember which one) and this screensaver was the author's favorite. His reasons being that in the sixties people believed that in the future there would be a space-age and we all would be floating around in space. But instead there now is a computer-age.

Anyway... i took a large portion of the minified code from a js1k demo (http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/warpfield/index-original.html) and started porting it into more readable code (which is about half done) and also restyled the whole thing. Still kinda work in progress, i guess.
